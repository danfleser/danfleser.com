# 1. Object.entries

Most developers use `Object.keys` method to iterate over an object. This method only returns an array of the object keys, not values. We can use `Object.entries` to get both key and value.

```js
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 20,
};
Object.keys(person); // ['name', 'age']
Object.entries(data); // [['name', 'John'], ['age', 20]]
```

And to iterate over an object we can do the following:

```js
Object.keys(person).forEach((key) => {
  console.log(`${key} is ${person[key]}`);
});
// using entries to get key and value both
Object.entries(person).forEach(([key, value]) => {
  console.log(`${key} is ${value}`);
});
// expected output:
// name is John
// age is 20
```

Both approaches above return the same result but Object.entries makes it easy to get key-value pair.

# 2. String replaceAll Method

In JavaScript, to replace all occurrences of a string with another string, we need to use a Regular Expression like the following:

```js
const str = "Red-Green-Blue";
// replaces the first occurrence only
str.replace("-", " "); // Red Green-Blue
// use RegEx to replace all occurrences
str.replace(/-/g, " "); // Red Green Blue
```

But in ES12, a new method is added to `String.prototype` named `replaceAll` which replaces all occurrences of a string with another string value.

```js
str.replaceAll("-", " "); // Red Green Blue
```

# 3. Numeric Separator

You can use an underscore `_` as a numeric separator, which makes it easy to count the number of zeros in a number.

```js
// difficult to read
const billion = 1000000000; // easier to read
const readableBillion = 1000_000_000;
console.log(readableBillion); // returns 1000000000
```

The underscore separator can also be used with BigInt numbers, like the following example:

```js
const trillion = 1000_000_000_000n;
console.log(trillion); // 1000000000000
```

# 4. document.designMode

Related to the frontend JavaScript, the design mode lets you edit any of the content on the page. Just open the browser console and type the following:

```js
document.designMode = "on";
```

Try yourself

It is helpful for designers as they don’t have to change things in code every time to the change on the screen.

# 5. Logical Assignment Operator

Logical assignment operators are a combination of logical operators `&&`, `||`, `??` and assignment operator `=`.

```js
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
a &&= b;
console.log(a); // returns 2
// the above statement is equivalent to
a && (a = b); // OR another approach
if (a) {
  a = b;
}
```

We’re checking if the value of `a` is truthy, if it is then we’re updating the value of `a`. The same can be done with logical OR `||` operator.

```js
const a = null;
const b = 3;
a ||= b;
console.log(a); // returns 3
// the above statement is equivalent to
a || (a = b);
```

And with the Nullish Coalescing operator `??`.

```js
const a = null;
const b = 3;
a ??= b;
console.log(a); // returns 3
// the above statement is equivalent to
if (a === null || a === undefined) {
  a = b;
}
```

The `??` operator only checks for `null` or `undefined` values.
