They correspond to some raw memory allocated outside \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"V8\"),\". Buffers are an array of integers that can\\u2019t be resized having a whole bunch of methods specifically for binary data. For example, the integers in buffer represent a byte with limited values from \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"0\"),\" to \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"255\"),\" inclusive, if you \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"strong\"},\"console.log()\")),\" to print a Buffer instance, a chain of values in hexadecimal will be received.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"Module System:\"),\" As a part of the Node.js ecosystem you will be using the Module for implementing complex functionality by just using the Modules provided by Node.js, these are JavaScript files that contain all the organized and complex features that anyone can reuse through the Node.js application.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Development Skills\"),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"Version Control Systems (Git, GitHub):\"),\" You don\\u2019t want to be in a situation where you mess up something in your code while having no idea how to revert it.

Open-source backend software developed by Oracle, also with MySQL we get the flexibility of choices as we can change the source code according to the needs.

There are several reasons why you should opt for MariaDB instead of MySQL for large-scale applications. For example, MariaDB has a larger connection pool supporting up to 200,000+ connections whereas MySQL has a smaller connection pool. \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"In short,\"),\" \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"strong\"},\"MariaDB\")),\" \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"is faster than\"),\" \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"strong\"},\"MySQL\")),mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\".\")),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Cloud Database Services\"),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"Azure CosmosDB:\"),\" A database service that is globally distributed, you can manage your data remotely, using cloud databases gave you many advantages as scaling and managing big applications becomes a bit easy with the tool that you can use to scale and distribute, all provided by \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"Microsoft Azure\"),\". Also, it supports multiple data models using one backend, which means it can be used for the document, key-value, relational & graph models. As it doesn\\u2019t rely on any schemas you can call it a \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"NoSQL\"),\" database, but it does support query language with \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"strong\"},\"ACID\")),\" transaction support.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"Amazon DynamoDB:\"),\" As far as my knowledge \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"Amazon DynamoDB\"),\" is a great alternative if you already have some experience with SQL, it is a fully managed NoSQL database service providing faster and predictable performance with awesome scalability. You can create databases tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data and serve any level of request traffic\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"NoSQL Databases\"),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"MongoDB:\"),\" A document-oriented NoSQL database specifically used for high volume data storage, as we have tables and rows in other relational databases, MongoDB uses collections and documents. A document consists of key-value pairs that are just basic unit of data in MongoDB & collection contains sets of documents and function which is the equivalent of relational databases tables\"),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"Redis:\"),\" Using Redis we can work with databases, caching, and message broking. It uses data structures like \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"strings, hashes, lists, sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs\"),\" & \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"geospatial indexes\"),\" to store data in the form of key-value pairs. If you are confused about where we use Redix, here is an example of that.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Let\\u2019s say in our application we have to deal with users who are authorized to take different actions within the application, each time we authenticate a user we have to derive their authorization for controlling acces in the applicaation.There is nothing buggy about this approach as we have good standards like \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"JOSE\"),\" while keeping our \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"key material safe\"),\", but if our application has more than a couple of authorisations, the same becomes very hard to scale. And instead of sendind the list of authorization to the user, we can store the user\\u2019s authorization in some form of database and provide the user a \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"key-value\"),\" (known as a token) which they have to send us for authorization.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Apache Cassandra\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"A highly scalable with high-performance and distributed database designed to handle a large amount of data across many servers, with no single point of failure.

Using ElasticSearch you can store, and analyze huge volumes of data in real-time. As it searches the index instead of searching the text, great search performance is also achieved in ElasticSearch. At its core, it uses structure-based documents instead of tables and schemas that come with extensive \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"strong\"},\"REST APIs\")),\" for storing and searching data. You can think of ElasticSearch as a server that processes \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"strong\"},\"JSON\")),\" requests and giving you back JSON data.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Memory Cache\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"This technique is also commonly called caching as most of the time, the caching is associated with the memory in servers. In this technique, a portion of the server\\u2019s memory is used as a cache where we store all the data that is required to reduce network calls in our applications. In Node.js we have \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"node-cache\"),\" and \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"memory-cache\"),\" as some great libraries to handle memory cache in a Node server.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Distributed Cache\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In this caching technique we combine the memory of multiple networks into a single memory data store which we later use as the final data cache to prove fast access to the data. This technique is especially used in a high volume of data and a huge number of network calls at the same time allows incremental expansion and scaling by adding more server memory to the cluster.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Socket.io\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"There is a lot when it comes to understanding real-time communication in Socket.IO if you are just getting started as a backend developer, the main logic behind real-time communication stands between the \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"client\"),\" and the \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"server.\"),\" It allows the flow of \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"bi-directional\"),\" data between the client & server, you can think of bi-directional data flow as the synchronous flow of data between two terminals to achieve the real-time communication behavior, these types of behavior are enabled when the client has Socket.IO in the browser along with the server integrated with Socket.IO package. And the data can be sent in the form of \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"JSON\"),\" requests.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"REST\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Before REST, APIs were developed around a remote procedure call (RPC) and the APIs looked like some locally executed code.
