/>

# 4\. Use Wild Cards in Your Search Term

When you use an asterisk (\*) in the search terms, this acts as a placeholder that Google automatically fills before delivering the results.

# 5\. Find Websites Similar to Another Website

# 6\. Search a Website Using Google

Did you know that you can search inside a website using Google? With this feature, you can find articles, blog posts, and pages published on a particular site — especially when it doesn’t have a built-in search feature available.

<img
  src="/images/20220212095550-search-website.png"
  alt="Searching within a site"
/>

# 7\. Gradually Increase the Words in Your Search Term

Google recommends that you start a search with only the basic search terms. For example, if you are trying to find courses for learning Javascript, start with the most basic phrase and gradually increase the number of words in your search term until you find what you are looking for:

- JavaScript courses
- JavaScript courses for beginners
- JavaScript courses for beginners Youtube

Following this searching strategy has a few benefits. Using a broader search term first gives you the chance to see the big picture of the topic and the different avenues available to take. It also ensures that you don’t miss any important information by going straight to a refined, focused search term. As you add more words to the search term, you get to see results that are more targeted to your specific needs.

            <title><![CDATA[5 CSS Practices To Avoid as a Web Developer]]></title>
            <link>https://danfleser.com/posts/20220212092333-avoid-css-practices</link>
            <guid>20220212092333-avoid-css-practices</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 12 Feb 2022 09:23:33 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
# 1\. Using the Same Rule Repetitively

A lot of beginners use repetitive rules for each element. If you want to create a rule for multiple elements, use a class attribute instead.

Do not do this:

```css
#intro1 {
  color: #3498db;
  font-size: 10px;
  font-weight: bold;
}

header {
  color: #3498db;
  font-size: 20px;
  background-color: green;
}

#banner {
  color: #3498db;
  font-size: 30px;
  background-image: url(images/static.jpg);
}
```

You can use:

```css
.blue {
  color: #3498db;
}
```

# 2\. Shoving everything into one CSS file

Having a 3500 line CSS file is NOT the way to go. Even if you minify at a later date. You should start separating them into the 'views' or 'components' when you are working on a bigger project.

# 3\. Naming your CSS selectors unnecessarily descriptive

'.sqaured-yellow-border-card' when '.card' will be suffice

# 4\. !important this, !important that, !important !important

People who know how to write CSS never use these.

# 5\. Set Margins or Padding and Then Reset Them

I often see people set margins or padding for all elements and then reset them for the first or last element. I don’t know why they use two rules when you can get by with one. It’s much easier to set margins and padding for all the required elements at once.

Use one of the following for simpler and more concise CSS: `nth-child`/`nth-of-type` selectors, the `:not()` pseudo-class, or the adjacent sibling combinator better known as `+`.

Do not do this:

```css
.item {
  margin-right: 1.6rem;
}

.item:last-child {
  margin-right: 0;
}
```

You can use:

```css
.item:not(:last-child) {
  margin-right: 1.6rem;
}
```

Or

```css
.item:nth-child(n + 2) {
  margin-left: 1.6rem;
}
```

Or

```css
.item + .item {
  margin-left: 1.6rem;
}
```

            <link>https://danfleser.com/posts/20220212071527-div-tag</link>
            <guid>20220212071527-div-tag</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 12 Feb 2022 07:15:27 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
Does your HTML markup look like this 👆?

So you've made a delicious [div soup](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/html5-web-components-overview)?, no problem. I'm here to help.

Writing [Semantic HTML](https://www.lifewire.com/why-use-semantic-html-3468271) gives your markup meaning to web browsers and screen readers and helps with SEO which brings your website on top of search engine results.

> “The `div` element has no special meaning at all…Authors are strongly encouraged to view the `div` element as an element of last resort, for when no other element is suitable. Use of more appropriate elements instead of the `div` element leads to better accessibility for readers and easier maintainability for authors.”

# The `Main` Element

The [main](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main) element indicates to browsers and screen readers which portion of your markup contains the main section of content on a given page. This can help with keyboard command access, zooming on mobile browsers, and more. It should be used only once per page.

```html
<main>
  <h1>Most Popular Browsers</h1>
  <p>Chrome, Firefox, and Edge are the most used browsers today.</p>

  <article>
    <h2>Google Chrome</h2>
    <p>
      Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google, released in 2008.
      Chrome is the world's most popular web browser today!
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>Mozilla Firefox</h2>
    <p>
      Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser developed by Mozilla.
      Firefox has been the second most popular web browser since January, 2018.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>Microsoft Edge</h2>
    <p>
      Microsoft Edge is a web browser developed by Microsoft, released in 2015.
      Microsoft Edge replaced Internet Explorer.
    </p>
  </article>
</main>
```

# The `Section` Element

The [section](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section) element is used to group content by theme and represents a section of a document or application. Sections can have their own `header` and `footer` elements, and there can be multiple `section` elements used on a single page.

```html
<section>
  <h2>WWF History</h2>
  <p>
    The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international organization
    working on issues regarding the conservation, research and restoration of
    the environment, formerly named the World Wildlife Fund. WWF was founded in
    1961.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>WWF's Symbol</h2>
  <p>
    The Panda has become the symbol of WWF. The well-known panda logo of WWF
    originated from a panda named Chi Chi that was transferred from the Beijing
    Zoo to the London Zoo in the same year of the establishment of WWF.
  </p>
</section>
```

# The `Aside` Element

The [aside](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside) elements are mainly used to represent part of a page containing related content to a given section. Asides are typically used as sidebars.

```html
<p>
  My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was nice,
  and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with my family!
</p>

<aside>
  <h4>Epcot Center</h4>
  <p>
    Epcot is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring exciting
    attractions, international pavilions, award-winning fireworks and seasonal
    special events.
  </p>
</aside>
```

# The `Article` Element

The [article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article) element can be used for portions of content that could stand on their own. Blog posts, newspaper articles, and user comments are some possible use cases the the `article` element.

```html
<article>
  <h2>Google Chrome</h2>
  <p>
    Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google, released in 2008. Chrome
    is the world's most popular web browser today!
  </p>
</article>

<article>
  <h2>Mozilla Firefox</h2>
  <p>
    Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser developed by Mozilla. Firefox
    has been the second most popular web browser since January, 2018.
  </p>
</article>

<article>
  <h2>Microsoft Edge</h2>
  <p>
    Microsoft Edge is a web browser developed by Microsoft, released in 2015.
    Microsoft Edge replaced Internet Explorer.
  </p>
</article>
```

# The `Blockquote` Element

The [blockquote](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote) element represents content that is being quoted from an external source (a person, document, newspaper, case study, etc.). It is often accompanied by the `cite` element to attribute the quote to its source.

```html
<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
  For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature. The world's
  leading conservation organization, WWF works in 100 countries and is supported
  by 1.2 million members in the United States and close to 5 million globally.
</blockquote>
```

# The `Nav` Element

The [nav](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav) elements represent the navigation section of a document. The `nav` element should include the primary navigation links for a give page, application, etc.

```html
<nav>
  <a href="/html/">HTML</a> | <a href="/css/">CSS</a> |
  <a href="/js/">JavaScript</a> |
  <a href="/python/">Python</a>
</nav>
```

# The `Header` Element

The [header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header) element represents the “header” section of a document or section. In many websites, the `header` element will contain introductory content but also a logo, a search form, an author name.

```html
<header>
  <h1>A heading here</h1>
  <p>Posted by John Doe</p>
  <p>Some additional information here</p>
</header>
```

# The `Footer` Element

The [footer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer) element represents the “footer” section of a document or section. In many websites, the `footer` element will contain contact and copyright information, a brief “about” blurb, social media logos and links, etc.

```html
<header>
  <p>Author: Hege Refsnes</p>
  <p><a href="mailto:hege@example.com">hege@example.com</a></p>
</header>
```

Now that we know about some semantically optimized alternatives to the `div` element, how do we know when to use each of them? And when (if ever) is it ok to still use `div` elements in our markup? [HTML5 Doctor](http://html5doctor.com) has a really handy flowchart to help answer that question:

            <link>https://danfleser.com/posts/20220212062358-api-architecture</link>
            <guid>20220212062358-api-architecture</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 12 Feb 2022 06:23:58 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
# 1\. Learn the basics of [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)

- HTTP has **verbs** (actions or methods): GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE are most common.
- REST is **resource-oriented** and a resource is represented by an **URI**: `/library/`
- An **endpoint** is the combination of a verb and an URI, example: `GET: /books/`
- An endpoint can be interpreted as an _action performed on a resource_**_._** Example: `POST: /books/` may mean "Create a new book".
- At a high-level, **verbs map to CRUD operations**: `GET` means `Read`, `POST` means `Create`, `PUT` and `PATCH` mean `Update`, and `DELETE` means `Delete`
- A response’s status is specified by its **status code**: `1xx` for **information**, `2xx` for **success**, `3xx` for **redirection**, `4xx` for **client errors** and `5xx` for **server errors**

# 2\. Do not return plain text

Most REST APIs by convention use JSON as the data format.

You should still **specify the** `**Content-Type: application/json**` **header.**

# 3\. Do not use verbs in URIs

\# Don’t do this
GET: /books/:slug/getBook/
\# Do this
GET: /books/:slug

\# Don’t do this
POST: /books/createNewBook/
\# Do this
POST: /books/

This is because the **HTTP verbs should be sufficient to accurately describe the action being performed on the resource**.

# 4\. Use plural nouns for resources

**My personal advice is to _use the plural form_.**

GET: /books/2/
POST: /books/
...

# 5\. Return the error details in the response body

When an API server handles an error, it is convenient (\*and recommended\*) to return **error details** within the JSON body to **help consumers with debugging**. Even better if you include which fields were affected by the error!

{
"error": "Invalid payload.",
"detail": {
"name": "This field is required."
}
}

# 6\. Pay special attention to HTTP status codes

> _The worst thing your API could do is_ return an error response _with a_ `_200 OK_` _status code._

**Make use of the HTTP status code, and use the response body to provide error details**.

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json{
"error": "Expected at least three items in the list."
}

# 7\. You should use HTTP status codes consistently

GET: 200 OK
PUT: 200 OK
POST: 201 Created
PATCH: 200 OK
DELETE: 204 No Content


# 8\. Make use of the querystring for filtering and pagination

Your consumers may want to retrieve items that fulfill a specific condition, or retrieve them in small amounts at a time to improve performance.

With **filtering**, consumers can specify parameters (or properties) that the returned items should have.

**Pagination** allows consumers to retrieve _fractions of the set of data_. The simplest kind of pagination is **page number pagination**, which is determined by a `page` and a `page_size`.

GET: /books?page=1&page_size=10

\# Don’t do this
GET: /books/published/
\# Do this
GET: /books?published=true&page=2&page_size=10

# 9\. Do not nest resources

My personal recommendation is to **use query string parameters** to filter the `books` resource directly:

GET: /books?author=Dan

And this clearly means: “Get all books for author name Dan”

# 10\. Know the difference between `401 Unauthorized` and `403 Forbidden`

- Has the consumer not provided authentication credentials? Was their SSO Token invalid/timed out? 👉 `401 Unauthorized`.
- Was the consumer _correctly authenticated_, but they _don’t have the required permissions/proper clearance_ to access the resource? 👉 `403 Forbidden`.

            <link>https://danfleser.com/posts/20220211001015-negotiate-salary</link>
            <guid>20220211001015-negotiate-salary</guid>
            <pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 00:10:15 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
## When making a big professional change, you may not feel you’re entitled to ask for more money. Do it anyway.

There’s a lot of excellent negotiating advice available. You can find it in dozens of career books or online. Here’s a quick synopsis:

- Defer the in-depth salary discussion until after you have an official offer in hand.
- Research your market value and how to relay it to the employer based on what you bring to the role.
- Focus on your worth in the market, not what you personally want or need or what you were making in the last position.
- Never accept an offer on the spot, even a seemingly great offer. There’s always something to negotiate.
- Negotiate directly with the hiring manager (versus the headhunter or human resources).
- Be confident and respectful, not demanding or entitled.
- Don’t drag out the negotiations over multiple meetings. Know your negotiating points and alternative options so you can be efficient.
- Know your BATNA (best alternative to a negotiated agreement) and your walk-away number.

All these steps are important. Just add this one vital strategy: _Go into the negotiation meeting assuming positive intent on the part of the hiring manager._ While it’s advisable to prepare your rationale—it will give you the confidence and data support you need—you’ll end up with a better outcome by going into the discussion expecting success. Hiring managers anticipate that you will negotiate. Unless your requests are completely unreasonable or presented as demands, managers will likely be happy to revise the offer if they’re able. Even if they can’t give you exactly what you want, ask if they can meet you in the middle.

Keep the large view of a compensation package in mind. Look at the _total_ compensation. You may not be losing as much as you think if the company covers tuition reimbursement and your commute requires much less gas. It’s worth the extra effort to think creatively. Perhaps you have experiences that will add additional value. If your desktop publishing skills could save the company $5,000 annually on an external vendor, maybe they could add this amount to your salary when they hire you. Remember, if you don’t ask, the answer is always no.

## JavaScript

- Arrow Functions
- Types
- Expressions
- Functions
- Lexical Structures
- this
- Loops and Scope
- Arrays
- Template Literals
- Strict Mode
- ES6/ES7
- Timers
- Promises
- Closures
- The Event Loop
- Async programming and callbacks

## Node.js Basics

**Event Emitters:** They are objects in **Node.js** that trigger events by sending a message to signal that an action was completed. We can also write our own code that listens to events from an event emitter. _For example_, if you have done some frontend work, then you probably know how much interaction we need to handle in our applications, such as **mouse clicks, keyboard button presses,** and other mouse movements. Similarly, on the backend environment in Node.js, we can build a similar system using the events module, which offers **EventEmitter** class which we use to handle our events.

**Callbacks:** These are functions called when a task is completed, which prevents any kind of blocking while allowing the rest of the code to run in the meantime. As we have to work with a lot of asynchronous tasks in Node.js, we need them everywhere for making seamless and faster applications. **For example,**

**Buffers:** A class called Buffer in Node.js is designed to handle raw binary data. They correspond to some raw memory allocated outside **V8**. Buffers are an array of integers that can’t be resized having a whole bunch of methods specifically for binary data. For example, the integers in buffer represent a byte with limited values from **0** to **255** inclusive, if you **_console.log()_** to print a Buffer instance, a chain of values in hexadecimal will be received.

**Module System:** As a part of the Node.js ecosystem you will be using the Module for implementing complex functionality by just using the Modules provided by Node.js, these are JavaScript files that contain all the organized and complex features that anyone can reuse through the Node.js application.

## Development Skills

**Version Control Systems (Git, GitHub):** You don’t want to be in a situation where you mess up something in your code while having no idea how to revert it. Using VCS like **Git** you can manage large scale projects & if you are already pretty familiar with using VCS then make sure that you have strong fundamental of Version Control Systems.

**HTTP/HTTPS protocols:** A fundamental knowledge of how the data is transferred using the transfer protocols will make you a better Node.js developer, a good understanding of how HTTP and HTTPS work is something every backend developer should understand well enough. HTTPS uses an encryption protocol known as Transport Layer Security **(TLS)**to encrypt communications. There is a lot to learn in the backend environment and it might get a little foggy for you if you had no idea how the web works, there are 4 request methods responsible for any basic communication on the web:

- **GET:** Used to retrieve a representation of a resource
- **POST:** Used to create new resources
- **PUT:** Used to update capabilities
- **PATCH:** Used to modify capabilities
- **DELETE:** Used to delete a resource identified by a URL
- **OPTIONS:** Request permitted communication option for a given URL or server

## Web Frameworks

**Express.js:** Provides a very minimal interface and tools that are required to build our application, quite flexible to use, and comes with numerous modules available on **npm** which can be plugged directly into Express.

**Koa.js:** If you are looking to build robust applications that are future proof and easy to maintain then Koa.js is a good choice. A **Koa** application is an object containing an array of some middleware functions that are later executed in a manner of stacks.

**Nest.js:** Inspired by Angular and built with **TypeScript**, uses Express.js under the hood which makes it compatible with most of Express middleware. You can build an efficient and scalable application with Nest.js as it provides a great modular structure for organizing code into separate modules.

## Database Management

**SQL Server:** A relational database management system developed by Microsoft, it supports **ANSI SQL** (a standard SQL language). However, SQL comes with its own implementations.

**MySQL:** Another great database management system that allows you to mage relational databases. Open-source backend software developed by Oracle, also with MySQL we get the flexibility of choices as we can change the source code according to the needs. MySQL is a pretty easy alternative as compared to **Oracle Database** & **Microsoft SQL server.**

**PostgreSQL:** Developed by a worldwide team of developers as it is open source. It runs on all major operating systems including Linux, UNIX & Windows. PostgreSQL supports a large part of the SQL standard while offering some great features such as **Complex SQL queries, Foreign Keys, Trigger, Transactions, Multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), Streatimg Repllicartons, etc.**

**MariaDB:** An improved version of MySQL that comes which various inbuilt powerful features, security, and performance improvements that you will not find in MySQL. There are several reasons why you should opt for MariaDB instead of MySQL for large-scale applications. For example, MariaDB has a larger connection pool supporting up to 200,000+ connections whereas MySQL has a smaller connection pool. _In short,_ **_MariaDB_** _is faster than_ **_MySQL_**_._

## Cloud Database Services

**Azure CosmosDB:** A database service that is globally distributed, you can manage your data remotely, using cloud databases gave you many advantages as scaling and managing big applications becomes a bit easy with the tool that you can use to scale and distribute, all provided by **Microsoft Azure**. Also, it supports multiple data models using one backend, which means it can be used for the document, key-value, relational & graph models. As it doesn’t rely on any schemas you can call it a **NoSQL** database, but it does support query language with **_ACID_** transaction support.

**Amazon DynamoDB:** As far as my knowledge **Amazon DynamoDB** is a great alternative if you already have some experience with SQL, it is a fully managed NoSQL database service providing faster and predictable performance with awesome scalability. You can create databases tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data and serve any level of request traffic

## NoSQL Databases

**MongoDB:** A document-oriented NoSQL database specifically used for high volume data storage, as we have tables and rows in other relational databases, MongoDB uses collections and documents. A document consists of key-value pairs that are just basic unit of data in MongoDB & collection contains sets of documents and function which is the equivalent of relational databases tables

**Redis:** Using Redis we can work with databases, caching, and message broking. It uses data structures like **strings, hashes, lists, sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs** & **geospatial indexes** to store data in the form of key-value pairs. If you are confused about where we use Redix, here is an example of that.

Let’s say in our application we have to deal with users who are authorized to take different actions within the application, each time we authenticate a user we have to derive their authorization for controlling acces in the applicaation.There is nothing buggy about this approach as we have good standards like **JOSE** while keeping our **key material safe**, but if our application has more than a couple of authorisations, the same becomes very hard to scale. And instead of sendind the list of authorization to the user, we can store the user’s authorization in some form of database and provide the user a **key-value** (known as a token) which they have to send us for authorization.

## Apache Cassandra

A highly scalable with high-performance and distributed database designed to handle a large amount of data across many servers, with no single point of failure. Created at **Facebook** it differs from other relational database management systems. The distributed design is based on Amazon’s **DynamoDB** and the data model on **Google’s BigTable**.

## Search Engines

**_Note:_** _If you are thinking why do we need a search engine, then here is an example, we use Google as a search engine, but that’s itself a whole web based application._ **_Solr_** _and_ **_ElasticSearch_** _are backend frameworks and if any type of data set is provided it creates an index on top of that while making that data available for search on a server. You can maintain a website with million of users with Solr as the search engine._

## ElasticSearch

A search and analytics engine built on **Apache Lucene** and developed in **Java**. Using ElasticSearch you can store, and analyze huge volumes of data in real-time. As it searches the index instead of searching the text, great search performance is also achieved in ElasticSearch. At its core, it uses structure-based documents instead of tables and schemas that come with extensive **_REST APIs_** for storing and searching data. You can think of ElasticSearch as a server that processes **_JSON_** requests and giving you back JSON data.

## Memory Cache

This technique is also commonly called caching as most of the time, the caching is associated with the memory in servers. In this technique, a portion of the server’s memory is used as a cache where we store all the data that is required to reduce network calls in our applications. In Node.js we have **node-cache** and **memory-cache** as some great libraries to handle memory cache in a Node server.

## Distributed Cache

In this caching technique we combine the memory of multiple networks into a single memory data store which we later use as the final data cache to prove fast access to the data. This technique is especially used in a high volume of data and a huge number of network calls at the same time allows incremental expansion and scaling by adding more server memory to the cluster.

## Socket.io

There is a lot when it comes to understanding real-time communication in Socket.IO if you are just getting started as a backend developer, the main logic behind real-time communication stands between the **client** and the **server.** It allows the flow of **bi-directional** data between the client & server, you can think of bi-directional data flow as the synchronous flow of data between two terminals to achieve the real-time communication behavior, these types of behavior are enabled when the client has Socket.IO in the browser along with the server integrated with Socket.IO package. And the data can be sent in the form of **JSON** requests.

## REST

Before REST, APIs were developed around a remote procedure call (RPC) and the APIs looked like some locally executed code. Many technologies tried to solve this problem using RPC-like stacks to hide the root problem and after that REST was introduced to build web-based APIs in a better way.

In REST the architecture is styled with simple HTTP calls to communicate instead of complex options like **COBRA, COM+, RPC**. In REST the calls are messages based and rely on the _HTTP_ standards to describe these messages. In the **_Node.js_** ecosystem, you can go for the **node-rest-client** and **Axios**, both serve pretty good service for faster web applications.

## GraphQL

A great alternative to REST, GraphQL uses the APIs that prioritize giving clients exactly the data they request. A flexible and developer-friendly alternative, as you can deploy it even in an IDE known as **GraphiQL.** You also get the advantages to add or deprecate fields without impacting existing **queries** and build APIs with whatever method is preferred.

## Unit Testing Frameworks

**Jest:** A very popular testing framework known for its simplicity and developed by **Facebook**. Among all the testing frameworks Jest has the best documentation with parallel testing support, which means that you can run each test in their own process to maximize performance.

**Mocha:** It serves the old standards of Unit Testing frameworks for Node applications and supports async operations like callbacks, promises with highly extensible and customizable assertions.

**Chai:** It can be used alongside Mocha and can be used as a **_TDD/BDD_** assertion library for Node.js that can be paired with any testing framework based on **JavaScript**.

## 1. Adding console logs to render expressions

If you wanna log the props to an expression style component but can’t be bothered to convert it, put the log in parentheses then add chopsticks `||`:

<img
  src="/images/20220210230144-1.png"
  alt="Adding console logs to render expressions"
/>

Note. you have to use the _or_ operator because console.log returns undefined.

## 2. Trace a function’s call with the Error object

If you’ve no idea where a function’s being called from, log an `Error` object in it and you’ll get a stack trace in the console:

<img
  src="/images/20220210230144-2.png"
  alt="Trace a function’s call with the Error object"
/>

## 3. Ternary question marks

Want to write more ternary question marks? Most people know that using `||` and `&&` is a super quick way of writing conditions, but did you know there’s a `??` as well?

<img src="/images/20220210230144-3.png" alt="Ternary question marks" />

This says, if `state?.bookings` is undefined return `{}`.

## [Slack](http://slack.com)

Really does take the cake when it comes to company wide communication.
Integrations and automations (Zoom, Around, Linear, Figma, etc) to make things easier to view, monitor, and/or take action on.

It’s the most powerful and effective tool I use every single day.

## [Zoom](http://zoom.us)

The easiest and most reliable video/audio conferencing software I’ve ever used, period.

## [Notion](http://notion.so)

I quickly realized Notion is one of the most flexible “productivity” apps that I’ve ever used — one piece of software to take meeting notes, write requirements, connect pieces of data between pages and tables, and much more. I use Notion multiple times a day and actually look forward to the experience.

## [Otter.ai](http://otter.ai)

Interesting tool that helps me record (audio only) and transcribe important meetings.

## [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/)

Allows for playback session of users sessions and makes it extremely easy to gather feedback from actual users.

## [Linear](http://linear.app)

The better task management tools I’ve used in my PM career — I call it JIRA’s hipster, younger brother. It’s straightforward and makes sense to track software development projects, software bugs, roadmaps, etc.

## [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/)

My preferred tool for wireframing, process documentation, prototyping, etc. It’s extremely simple while remaining wildly flexible and collaborative.

A good project manager also has to have a standing desk.

## Which tech stack to use

MEAN is an open source, high-level, **Javascript-based stack** best used for building dynamic websites and applications.

<img src="/images/mean.png" alt="MEAN stack" />

The layers of MEAN are:

- [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/): A NoSQL database that uses binary JSON documents with schema.
- [**Express.js**](https://expressjs.com/): A modular web application framework for Node.js.
- [**AngularJS**](https://angularjs.org/): A client-side application framework used to build end-user interfaces separate from the business logic. Can also be replaced with similar popular frontend frameworks like React or Vue.
- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/): An application runtime environment that represents the “JavaScript everywhere” paradigm that MEAN is known for.

Used by Netflix, Paypal, The Weather Channel, and Forbes.

**Pros**

- All tools are open source and use JavaScript, allowing for full-stack development.
- Great performance for SPAs.
- Usable on any operating system.

**Cons**

- Hard to adopt into existing architectures that don't use JavaScript.
- Risk losing data during heavy workflows.
- Maintenance can be a hassle, frequent updates and changes.

## MERN

The MERN stack is a variation on MEAN that replaces Angular with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

<img src="/images/react-mern.png" alt="MERN stack" />

**Pros**

- Build a simple to intermediate single-page application in the quickest time possible.
- Optimized for SPAs.
- There are more React developers than Angular developers.

**Cons**

- Sacrificing some functionality without a full framework

## MEVN

Similar to MERN, MEVN replaces Angular with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

**Pros**

- Faster performance than React and Angular
- Ready to go right out of the box
- Cost-effective due to simplicity to use

**Cons**

- Might lack some resources, as is the least popular of the three frameworks
- Scalability is not a big plus so don’t plan to add any fancy application features.

LAMP is the world’s **most popular tech stack**, designed to build applications without reliance on external software or data.

The layers of LAMP are

- [**Linux**](https://www.linux.org/): An open source, Unix-like operating system consisting of a package management system around a Linux kernel.
- [**Apache web server**](https://httpd.apache.org/): A highly popular and fully-featured web server, used by 54% of all sites on the web.
- [**MySQL**](https://www.mysql.com/): A multithreaded SQL relational database management system built for at-scale use.
- [**PHP**](https://www.php.net/): A server-side scripting language designed for web development.

**Pros**

- Widespread support for each technology in the stack.
- Mature stack with a wealth of previous solutions and customizations to draw from.
- Non-blocking structure makes it easy to scale and faster to develop.
- LAMP is fully open source.
- PHP and MySQL are easy to learn and work with.

**Cons**

- Limited to only Linux operating system.
- Difficult to switch between backend and frontend tools.
- Projected to decline in use over time due to the prevalence of JavaScript and the cloud.

## Serverless

Nowdays companies shift from managing their own app infrastructure to instead building cloud-native serverless applications.

**Pros**

- Perfect for small startup that cannot afford to hire a full team to manage your application’s tech stack
- Cost-effective for small businesses and startups.
- No need to manage or maintain your own technologies.

**Cons**

- Less control over what technologies are in the stack.
- Scaling costs will make this ineffective beyond a certain size.

How do you choose?

**You’ll want to consider**

- What type of app will it be? Cloud-based, hybrid, etc.?
- What is the expected lifetime of this application?
- What technologies are available in my client’s infrastructure? Will it be standardized or varied?
- How much traffic will your application need to handle? Does the traffic happen in spikes or steady flow?
- How dynamic will your application be? Will it update in real time?
- How much retraining will your team need to do?
- How much maintenance do you want to allocate to the application?

As a general rule, MEAN is better for smaller-scale modern applications, like progressive web apps, cloud-based applications, or single-page applications. LAMP is better for larger-scale applications that prioritize uptime and availability.
